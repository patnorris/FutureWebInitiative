    <h2 class="section-title">Let's Decentralize Each Layer of the Web Stack</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">In the journey to create a fully decentralized Web, we must analyze each layer of the current Web Stack: Users (and Other Entities), Devices, Applications, Protocols and Platforms, and Hosting. This analysis should consider the current degree of decentralization in each layer, including what improvements need to be made and how to make them. For example, while some layers may already have emerging decentralized solutions, others might still be reliant on centralized services. By juxtaposing centralized and decentralized instances within each layer, we can see the potential for further decentralization. The goal is not necessarily to eliminate centralized services but to provide alternatives and enrich the ecosystem, ultimately providing better control, privacy, and freedom to users across the globe.</p>
    <img class="intro-image" src="./FutureWebInitiative_DecentralizedTechStack_table.png" alt="The Decentralized Web Stack">
    <p class="intro-text">
        We are actively involved in the creation and development of innovative decentralized technologies. Two key projects we're focusing on are <a class='underline' href="#/bebbprotocol">Bebb Protocol</a> on the Protocols and Platforms layer, and the <a class='underline' href="#/openinternetmetaverse">Open Internet Metaverse</a> on the Applications layer. Both of these initiatives exemplify our commitment to creating a more decentralized Web, offering users new opportunities for control, privacy, and monetization.
